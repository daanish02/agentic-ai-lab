# Agentic AI Lab

## Purpose and Philosophy

This repository is a **comprehensive knowledge base** for agentic AI systems -- autonomous agents that can plan, reason, use tools, maintain memory, and accomplish complex goals. It focuses on **understanding agency**, **multi-step reasoning**, and building systems that act intelligently in pursuit of objectives.

The focus is on:

- **Agent architectures**: planning, reasoning, reflection, and decision-making
- **Tool use**: function calling, API integration, external system interaction
- **Memory systems**: short-term, long-term, episodic, semantic memory
- **Planning and reasoning**: multi-step planning, chain-of-thought, tree search, task decomposition
- **Orchestration patterns**: workflow graphs, state management, control flow, event-driven patterns
- **Agent capabilities**: artifacts, background processes, filesystem-based context, subagent spawning
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: standardizing agent-tool interaction, tool discovery, context management

This repository is **concept-first and framework-agnostic**. While examples may reference specific implementations, the emphasis is on **universal principles** and **architectural patterns** for building autonomous agents.

## Learning Principles

### Agents are More Than Prompts

Agents involve planning, memory, tool use, and iteration. They are systems, not single model calls.

### Reliability is the Challenge

Agents can fail in many ways: hallucination, tool misuse, infinite loops, poor planning. Design for robustness.

### Observability is Essential

Agents are opaque. Build logging, tracing, and observability into agent systems to understand behavior.

### MCP Enables Composability

The Model Context Protocol standardizes agent-tool interaction, enabling ecosystem-wide tool sharing and reuse.

### Evaluation is Non-Trivial

Measuring agent performance requires task-specific metrics and often human evaluation. Automated metrics are insufficient.
